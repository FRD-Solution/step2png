# step2png
 Transform .step file to .png and vice versa, to be used with app that do not support .step format (ex if you cannot share a zip and the step format is not supported as in office forms)
 You can execute the .py file or go to \dist\step2png and dowload the step2png.exe with the "_internal" to be used on any computer without python3.
 it'll create an IN and OUT folder on 1st use, then place the file in the IN folder -> execute step2png.exe and your file will be dropped in the OUT folder in the other format.
